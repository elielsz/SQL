#In this SQL, I'm query a database containing multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales fsales
ON cust.order_id=fsales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'OrderID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

WHERE location ="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity)*price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales sales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id=sales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'OrderID'
AND quantity >2

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
